# marvel-movies-api
## This is my Marvel Movies API. 
### It includes 3 endpoints.
#### The first endpoint is /random. It returns a random marvel movie.
#### The second endpoint is /find-by-name/<name>. If you replace <name> with the name of the movie, it will show you the details of that movie.
#### The third endpoint is /all. It returns details about every single marvel movie.
